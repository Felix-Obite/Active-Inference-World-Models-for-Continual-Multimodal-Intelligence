# Deep Bayesian Active Inference

This repository explores the integration of **Continual Learning Variational Autoencoders (CL-VAE)** with **Bayesian Active Inference (BAI)** for **incremental lifelong learning in autonomous robot navigation**. The aim is to develop intelligent agents capable of adapting to dynamic environments, retaining prior knowledge, and generalizing beyond their training experiences.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Continual Learning VAE (CL-VAE):** Supports lifelong learning by combining latent space modeling with experience replay to prevent catastrophic forgetting.
- **Bayesian World Model:** Captures the probabilistic structure of environmental dynamics and continuously updates beliefs based on new sensory inputs.
- **Active Inference:** Leverages epistemic value and information gain to guide exploration, reduce uncertainty, and plan actions efficiently in compressed latent space.

## 🧭 Application: Autonomous Robot Navigation

This framework aims to enable autonomous robots to:
- Continuously adapt to new environments and tasks.
- Retain and reuse previously acquired navigation strategies.
- Actively explore uncertain regions to improve learning and planning efficiency.

> **Note:**  Project is currently in development. Code and results will be shared soon.
